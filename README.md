# E-Commerce Angelo Pasta Store:
This repository is dedicated to the Final Delivery of the ReactJS module in the Full Stack Developer course at CoderHouse. The idea for this project is to create an E-Commerce platform for a pasta store that belongs to my family.

To achieve this, I created a product catalog divided by categories. Both the catalog and the categories are directly linked to Firebase. It also features a user login section that allows access with either a registered email or Google account.

Upon selecting a product, it can be added to the cart. After adding all the necessary products, the total cart value is calculated, displaying the final price before proceeding to the payment stage. After entering all the required information, the payment is processed, and the respective ID code is returned through an alert.
